            <li>Javascript</li>

        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line
            of text.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes you want to
            <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both.</em></strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>
            Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br />Neither can image tags,
            or hard lines.<br />
            Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line
            breaks to match your page to the sample.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>
            Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for
            accessibility.
